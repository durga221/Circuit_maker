## Problem Statement
Traditional circuit design is:
- Complex and time-consuming
- Requires expert knowledge
- Involves manual calculations
- Has a steep learning curve

TARA addresses these challenges through AI-driven automation that simplifies the design process while maintaining design integrity.

## Features
- **Automated Design**: Transform natural language requirements into functional circuit designs
- **Component Selection**: AI-driven selection of appropriate components based on requirements
- **Formula Retrieval**: Automatic application of relevant electrical formulas
- **Real-time Validation**: Circuit simulation and verification
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Iterative improvements to meet specified parameters

## How It Works
TARA employs a multi-agent AI system with the following specialized agents:

1. **Analyze Circuit Requirements**: Interprets and processes user specifications
2. **Select Appropriate Components**: Determines optimal components based on requirements
3. **Perform Small Signal Analysis**: Analyzes circuit behavior for AC signals
4. **Calculate Necessary Formulas**: Applies relevant electrical equations and principles
5. **Generate a Netlist**: Creates a text description of the circuit connectivity
6. **Convert Netlist to PySpice Code**: Transforms the netlist into simulation-ready code
7. **Simulate the Circuit**: Runs the circuit simulation to verify behavior
8. **Validate Performance**: Confirms the design meets the original requirements

### Example Workflow
```
User Input: "Design an amplifier circuit with a gain of 10 having input of 2V AC and 25V DC using resistors and capacitors."

AI Processing: 
- Determines requirements (gain=10, input=2V AC+25V DC)
- Selects appropriate amplifier topology
- Calculates component values (e.g., Rf = 9kΩ, Ri = 1kΩ, Cin = 0.1μF)
- Generates schematic
- Simulates performance
- Optimizes design if needed
```
